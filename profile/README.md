## 📝 • What comes after us?

Circuit Board won't live forever, Revolt.chat currently has plans to implement OAuth down the line, but there's *a lot* that still hasn't been done, once Revolt.chat finishes their OAuth we'll stick around (at minimum for 3 months, without the ability to register new apps) before shutting down. We'll make sure to give out proper notice, and we'll try our best to help you migrate!
